// Idea is : Instead of making a class, we make enum.
// enum is a class, except it has finite number of instances

// This singleton does not have previous problem like reflection scenario.
// But it has serialization problems. Enums don't save state (int his e.g. value).
// No inheritance possible in case of enums.
// Use this approach considering these limitations.
