## FACADE PATTERN

### FACADE :
    Provides a simple, easy to understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

### SUMMARY

- Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes. 
- May wish to optionally expose internals through the facade.
- May allow users to escalate to use more complex APIs if they need to.
