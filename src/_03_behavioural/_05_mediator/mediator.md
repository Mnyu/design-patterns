## MEDIATOR PATTERN

### MOTIVATION

- Components may go in and out of a system at any time.

    - Chat room participants.
    - Players in an online game.

- It makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another.

    - Those references may go dead.

- *Solution* : have them all refer to some central component that facilitates communication. 

### MEDIATOR :
    A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other or having direct(reference) access to each other.

### SUMMARY

- Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it.
  
  - e.g. as a field

- Mediator engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components.
- Mediator has functions that the components can call.
- Components have functions the mediator can call.
- Event processing libraries(e.g. Rx) make communication easier to implement.
