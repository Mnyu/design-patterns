## BUILDER PATTERN - SUMMARY

- A builder is a separate component for building an object.
- We can either give builder a constructor or return it via a static function.
- To make builder fluent, return ```this``` of builder.
- Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class.
